# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects 
# and their interactions to design and program applications

# - Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently 
# of other areas in the application.

# Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available 
# to the rest of the program

# Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software 
# solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it

# Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, 
# referred to as the superclass
# Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has the ability 
# to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. For example to write 
# a method that does something differently from the inherited method

# Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that 
# the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. 
# Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.
